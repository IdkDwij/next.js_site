In order to host this, you will need node.js and need to run this command
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"
then, replace the pages folder with the pages folder in this repo,
then open your terminal/cmd in that folder or cd into it then type
npm run dev
boom! This will start working
